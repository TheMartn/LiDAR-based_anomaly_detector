# LiDAR-based anomaly detector

Using LiDAR data to detect any anomalies an object of a kind may have in comparison to a predefined model.

_**Note:**
This is an end-of-degree project made for my Computer 
Science degree at University of Santiago de Compostela._

## Projects

The two existing subfolders contain a project each one:
- The main project of this repository is located in the `anomaly_detector/` folder. This project uses the obtained LiDAR data to characterize objects and detect any anomalies the may have.
- The `error_measuring/` project's goal is to measure the cuadratic error a LiDAR dataset may have using plane aproximations.
